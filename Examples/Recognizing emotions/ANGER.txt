It burns, it claws, it howls through my veins like a storm tearing down the walls of reason. The air itself feels sharp, cutting into me, mocking my attempts to breathe calmly. My hands tremble, not from weakness, but from the pure, raw surge of something ancient and furious that refuses to be silenced. Every sound becomes a spark; every word, an insult; every glance, a threat. The world turns red—not in color, but in meaning. Red is not just what I see, it’s what I am.

There is a pulse in my temples, pounding louder than any thought. It tells me to break, to destroy, to shout until the sky itself listens. I feel the injustice of everything — every betrayal, every time I swallowed my rage, every fake smile forced through clenched teeth. The mask cracks. The calm is gone. What remains is something primal, something that remembers pain and repays it a thousandfold.

I hate the stillness of the world when I’m this angry. It pretends not to see me. The walls just stand there, silent witnesses to my fury, and I want to make them speak. I want to smash them until they confess every lie they’ve absorbed. Even my reflection stares back with arrogance, daring me to strike it, to shatter that smug face that looks too much like mine.

The people around me talk of patience, of forgiveness, of peace. Useless words. Empty, fragile things for those who’ve never felt fire consuming their chest. Forgiveness is for the comfortable; patience is for the powerless. I am neither. I am the storm that has been denied too long, and now there is nothing left but the roar.

Every memory sharpens itself. Every wound reopens. I can taste the bitterness of years compressed into one moment of perfect, blinding anger. It’s strange how alive it makes me feel. The world feels clearer in rage, more honest. Masks fall off. Truth screams through the noise.

But anger is not pure. It corrupts. It whispers that everything is against me, that every shadow is an enemy, every silence a mockery. It feeds on my heart, gnawing it hollow, making room for more fury to grow. It isolates. It builds a world where only pain is real and everything else is a lie.

I hate what it does to me, yet I crave it. It gives me purpose when everything else feels empty. It gives me heat when all else is cold. I punch the air, and the sound feels like music — a rhythm of rebellion. The veins in my arms tighten like ropes. My jaw locks. My eyes water not from sorrow but from pressure, from the force of trying to contain something uncontainable.

And still, it grows. The rage fills every corner, every cell. It laughs when I try to reason with it. It doesn’t want reason. It wants release. Destruction. Catharsis. I want to scream until my voice tears apart. I want to feel something break beneath my hands, something that finally gives way to this chaos inside.

The world deserves to shake when I feel this way. The heavens should tremble. There is injustice everywhere, and I am the flame that knows it. I am not angry without reason; I am angry because I have seen too much. Because silence has never saved me. Because patience has never changed anything.

And yet, beneath it all, there is a strange sadness. Because I know this fire will consume me too. The anger that gives me strength also drains me. It leaves ashes where hope used to be. It builds walls that no one can cross. But for now, I don’t care. For now, I need the storm. For now, I am the storm
