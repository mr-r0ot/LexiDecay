Anna has a small garden behind her house. She wakes up early. She opens the window.
She sees the sun. The sun is warm. She puts on a light jacket. She walks outside. She smiles.
Anna loves her garden. The garden has many plants. There are flowers and small trees. There are green leaves.
She waters the plants with a small can. The water is cool. The plants drink the water slowly.
A bird sings on a branch. Anna listens. She writes a short note in her small notebook. She writes about the morning.
She writes one sentence and then another. She practices new words. She says the words out loud.
Today is a big day for the garden. A neighbor will come to help. The neighbor's name is Tom.
Tom is kind. He likes to plant seeds. Tom arrives at nine o'clock. He brings a small bag of soil and many seeds.
Anna and Tom talk about the flowers. They pick a corner near the fence. They dig small holes in the soil.
Anna uses a small shovel. Tom uses his hands and a little rake. They plant seeds in a row.
They put a small sign beside each row. The sign has the name of the plant. One sign says 'Tomato'. One sign says 'Carrot'.
Anna and Tom water the new seeds together. The sun moves in the sky. Clouds come and go.
People walk past the fence. The children point at the bright flowers near the gate. The children smile and wave.
A cat comes slowly. The cat sits on the path. The cat watches the small birds. The cat blinks and purrs.
Anna gives the cat a small piece of bread. The cat is happy. The bird flies up and sings again.
They take a short break. Anna makes tea in the kitchen. She takes the tea outside. The cup is warm in her hands.
Tom eats a small sandwich. They talk. They say simple words. They laugh at a small joke.
After lunch, they plant more seeds. They plant herbs near the window. They plant basil and mint.
The smell is fresh and green. Anna breathes slowly. She learns new words: 'soil', 'seed', 'sprout'.
At the end of the day, the sky becomes orange. The sun goes down. Anna and Tom clean the tools.
They look at the garden. The new plants are small but brave. Anna feels proud.
She writes in her notebook again. She writes: 'Today I planted seeds. I worked with a friend. I felt happy.'
She closes the notebook. The moon rises. The stars come out in the sky.
Anna says good night to the garden. She covers the small plants with a light cloth to keep them warm.
She goes inside and sleeps. In her dream, the garden grows tall. The flowers open and sing.
